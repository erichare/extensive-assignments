\section{Introduction}
As ``case-ready" or pre-packaged meat has become more popular, so has the need for investigating the aging process of the meats to determine appropriate shelf-life and packaging conditions. A new method which involves carbon monoxide being inserted into the packaging can prevent the discoloration of the meat. The question remains, however, as to whether quality degredation is prevented, or it is purely cosmetic.

Over 25 days, two steaks of the same grade were obtained every 12 hours, one using traditional packaging, and one using carbon monoxide processing. A proportional score between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best, was obtained for each of the total 100 steaks. We will use a beta random component in order to describe the variability in scores, and fit a regression in an attempt to compare the two packaging methods. Hence forth, group 1 and score 1 will refer to the original packaging method, while group 2 and score 2 will refer to the new carbon monoxide-based packaging method.
